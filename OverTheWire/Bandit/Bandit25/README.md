# Bandit Level 25 → Level 26

## Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

## Solution

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on
irc.overthewire.org.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with
  easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /usr/local/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /usr/local/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /usr/local/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
    * checksec.sh (http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html) in /usr/local/bin/checksec.sh

### Note1: Since user bandit26 is not using the normal /bin/bash shell the immediate loggeing out is taking place.

### Note2: Every user on a Linux system, whether created as an account for a real human being or associated with a particular service or system function, is stored in a file called /etc/passwd. The /etc/passwd file contains information about the users on the system. Each line describes a distinct user.
```
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26                          #read the /etc/passwd file for user bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext     #instead of using the usual /bin/bash, user bandit26 is using /usr/bin/showtext

bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext                                    #read that file
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux                                                           #sets the terminal emulator to linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```
### Note3: The above script is making the immediate logging out possible. To overcome that, gain access to ~/text.txt file before the connection terminates.

### Note4: The 'more' command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying one screen at a time in case the file is large or the terminal space is small. To enable more command, minimise our terminal’s screen size to ≤ 6 lines. This will prevents the script from executing exit 0 as the command above exit 0 in the script has a 'more' command that output the text file.

### Note5: The 'more' command consist of an interactive command. Pressing v while the 'more' command is running starts up an editor at current line.
